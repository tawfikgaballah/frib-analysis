     * An event is just a sequence (vector) of hits. Hits are stored here as 
     * pointers to DDASRootFitHit objects which are hits that are also derived 
     * from TObject.
     * @note The code assumes that the pointers in m_hits point to dynamically
     * allocated data. Thus the destructor will destroy the hits as well.
     * @note Copy construction and assignment are implemented as deep operations
     * as demanded by ROOT.
